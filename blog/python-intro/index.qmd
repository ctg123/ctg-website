Are you new to programming? Have questions about which language would be a good one to start?

Choosing which programming language to learn is more a personal preference depending on what project and solution you're looking to achieve. However, for a beginner, you have lots of flexibility to experiment with which one is right for you. One programming language I enjoy working with and others have found helpful is Python. I recommend installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to have more community support to be developed and used for years to come.

There are likely millions of developers worldwide using Python to build projects, tools and using it to teach others the fundamentals of programming. You can do all kinds of other fantastic work in a multitude of domains.

#### Example applications:

* Web applications
* Machine Learning / Deep learning
* Automating weekly emails
* Setting up jobs to update a spreadsheet
* etc.
