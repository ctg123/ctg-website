## Testing the image display

Welcome to my post about this mountain pic. I'm testing the external display of my assets hosted via [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation).

Cloudinary is a softwareâ€“as-a-service (SaaS) solution for developers. It provides programmable media APIs that enable you to automate the entire lifecycle of your image and video assets.

## Testing the Terminal recording on the website

## Testing the video displays

This example video shows its display also hosted via Cloudinary.
