# Understanding Household Energy Consumption

This project simulates and analyzes household energy consumption across different seasons and appliance types.

## Data Generation and Initial Analysis

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Generate synthetic energy consumption data
seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn']
appliances = ['Heating', 'Cooling', 'Lighting', 'Appliances']

# Create a dictionary to store our data
energy_data = {
    'Season': [],
    'Appliance': [],
    'Energy_Consumption': []
}

# Simulate energy consumption with seasonal variations
for season in seasons:
    for appliance in appliances:
        # Different base consumption and variance for each appliance and season
        if appliance == 'Heating':
            base = 50 if season in ['Winter', 'Autumn'] else 20
            variance = 15
        elif appliance == 'Cooling':
            base = 50 if season in ['Summer'] else 20
            variance = 15
        elif appliance == 'Lighting':
            base = 30 if season in ['Winter'] else 20
            variance = 10
        else:  # General Appliances
            base = 25
            variance = 5
        
        # Generate 30 data points (representing days in a month)
        consumption = np.random.normal(base, variance, 30)
        
        # Add to our data structure
        energy_data['Season'].extend([season] * 30)
        energy_data['Appliance'].extend([appliance] * 30)
        energy_data['Energy_Consumption'].extend(consumption)

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(energy_data)

# Box plot of energy consumption by season and appliance
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Season', y='Energy_Consumption', hue='Appliance', data=df)
plt.title('Energy Consumption by Season and Appliance')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Energy Consumption (kWh)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Calculate summary statistics
summary = df.groupby(['Season', 'Appliance'])['Energy_Consumption'].agg(['mean', 'std']).round(2)
print("Energy Consumption Summary:")
print(summary)
```

## Detailed Energy Consumption Analysis

```{python}
# Pivot table for easier comparison
pivot_table = df.pivot_table(
    values='Energy_Consumption', 
    index='Season', 
    columns='Appliance', 
    aggfunc='mean'
).round(2)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
pivot_table.plot(kind='bar', ax=plt.gca())
plt.title('Average Energy Consumption by Season and Appliance')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Average Energy Consumption (kWh)')
plt.legend(title='Appliance', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print the pivot table
print("\nAverage Energy Consumption by Season and Appliance:")
print(pivot_table)
```

## Key Insights

1. Energy consumption varies significantly across seasons and appliances.
2. Heating and cooling show the most pronounced seasonal variations.
3. The analysis provides insights into potential energy-saving strategies.

## Recommendations

- Focus on heating efficiency during winter months
- Implement smart cooling strategies in summer
- Consider energy-efficient lighting solutions
