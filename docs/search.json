    "text": "Are you new to programming? Have questions about which language would be a good one to start?\nChoosing which programming language to learn is more a personal preference depending on what project and solution you’re looking to achieve. However, for a beginner, you have lots of flexibility to experiment with which one is right for you. One programming language I enjoy working with and others have found helpful is Python. I recommend installing Python 3 to have more community support to be developed and used for years to come.\nThere are likely millions of developers worldwide using Python to build projects, tools and using it to teach others the fundamentals of programming. You can do all kinds of other fantastic work in a multitude of domains.\n\nExample applications:\n\nWeb applications\nMachine Learning / Deep learning\nAutomating weekly emails\nSetting up jobs to update a spreadsheet\netc.\n\n\n\nHelpful online resources & books\nYou can find plentiful resources to teach yourself Python or pair with a small group to work on projects!\nCodeacademy: Codeacademy offers free code tutorials that are very popular for a good reason. The tutorials should give you a good idea of what it’s like to code Python with hands-on lessons to write code.\nLearn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw: This book is well received and aims to teach beginners how to read and write basic Python to understand other books on Python. It is high quality which I recommend regardless of where your current skill is. You can try the free sample to see if it would work for you.\nReal Python: This website offers in-depth tutorials to learn any aspect of Python you may be curious to explore. Check it out and keep a list of articles for future reference!\nAutomate the boring stuff with Python by Al Sweigart: This is an enjoyable read and practical for anyone who is currently working a tedious, routine job! He also offers a video course provided through Udemy.\nUdemy: You can find all sorts of courses and projects offered on this online education website. They range from beginner to advanced and have instructors teaching financial topics such as predicting stock prices, data science, full-stack web development, and more.\nI’m confident your programming journey will be well on its way towards success. Feel free to discuss any other valuable resources or projects you’ve discovered learning Python. 👌🏾\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

First, connect via SSH to the virtual machine.\nPS C:\\\\..\\\\vagrant\\\\ubuntu_ansible&gt; vagrant ssh ansible-master\nBy default, Vagrant will be the user on the machine; however, an admin account with sudo privileges creates the specific purpose of using Ansible to talk to the other virtual machines in the network. Use the adduser command as the root user first to add a new user to your system:\nThere will be a prompt to enter a password of your choice.\nvagrant@ansible-master:~$ sudo -i\nroot@ansible-master:~# adduser admin\nUse the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group and test if the sudo commands work when logged into the user account.\nroot@ansible-master:~# usermod -aG sudo admin\nroot@ansible-master:~# su - admin\n\nadmin@ansible-master:~$ sudo apt-get update\nRun the following command to include the official project’s PPA (personal package archive) in your system’s list of sources:\nadmin@ansible-master:~$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible\nPress ENTER when prompted to accept the PPA addition.\nNext, refresh your system’s package index to be aware of the packages available in the newly included PPA and then proceed to install.\nadmin@ansible-master:~$ sudo apt-get update\nadmin@ansible-master:~$ sudo apt install ansible\n\nConfigure password-less authentication\nWe will set up password-less authentication for our admin user from master to all the managed nodes by generating a public-private key pair using ssh-keygen. We have pre-defined a blank password using -P “” This step will create private and public key pair located in the ~/.ssh directory.\nadmin@ansible-master:~$ ls -al ~/.ssh/\ntotal 20\ndrwx------ 2 admin admin 4096 Apr  3 08:03 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 admin admin 4096 Apr  4 22:57 ..\n-rw------- 1 admin admin 1675 Apr  3 07:49 id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin  402 Apr  3 07:49 id_rsa.pub\n-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin  444 Apr  3 07:48 known_hosts\nWe will use ssh-copy-id to copy the keys to the remote managed server and add it to authorized_keys.\nadmin@ansible-master:~$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vagrant@10.23.45.20\nadmin@ansible-master:~$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vagrant@10.23.45.20\n\n\nSSH and Admin user setup with Setup playbook\nThe setup_ubuntu1804 folder in the Github repository runs an independent playbook that will execute an initial server setup for the managed nodes. The options stores in the vars/default.yml variable file. We define the following setting below:\n\ncreate_user: The name of the remote sudo user to create. In our case, it will be admin.\ncopy_local_key: Path to a local SSH public key that will be copied as an authorized key for the new user. By default, it copies the key from the current system user running Ansible.\nsys_packages: An array with a list of fundamental packages to be installed.\n\nRun the playbook with the following commands.\nadmin@ansible-master:~/.../setup_ubuntu1804$ ansible-playbook -i inventory -u admin playbook.yml\nOnce the Playbook completes as successful, you can test the SSH connection with the following Ansible commands for our inventory with ansible all -i inventory -m ping and ansible-inventory -i inventory --list.\nadmin@ansible-master:~/.../setup_ubuntu1804$ ansible all -i inventory -m ping\nansible-node2 | SUCCESS =&gt; {\n    \"changed\": false,\n    \"ping\": \"pong\"\n}\nansible-node1 | SUCCESS =&gt; {\n    \"changed\": false,\n    \"ping\": \"pong\"\n}\n\nadmin@ansible-master:~/.../wordpress-lamp_ubuntu1804$ ansible-inventory -i inventory --list\n{\n    \"_meta\": {\n        \"hostvars\": {\n            \"ansible-node1\": {\n                \"ansible_host\": \"10.23.45.20\",\n                \"ansible_python_interpreter\": \"/usr/bin/python3\"\n            },\n            \"ansible-node2\": {\n                \"ansible_host\": \"10.23.45.30\",\n                \"ansible_python_interpreter\": \"/usr/bin/python3\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"all\": {\n        \"children\": [\n            \"servers\",\n            \"ungrouped\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"servers\": {\n        \"hosts\": [\n            \"ansible-node1\",\n            \"ansible-node2\"\n        ]\n    }\n}"

This list is extensive to support more features.\nmysql_root_password: The desired password for the root MySQL account.\nmysql_db: The name of the MySQL database intended for WordPress.\nmysql_user: The name of the MySQL user for WordPress.\nmysql_password: The password for the new MySQL user.\nhttp_host: Your domain name.\nhttp_conf: The name of the configuration file within Apache.\nhttp_port: HTTP port for the virtual host. By default, it is 80.\n\nOnce you’ve verified that the variables are correct, you can run the Playbook to install WordPress on the managed node(s) with the ansible-playbook command below:\nadmin@ansible-master:~/.../wordpress-lamp_ubuntu1804$ ansible-playbook -i inventory -u admin playbook.yml\nWhen the Playbook finishes all of its tasks, you should see a Play recap of all the events. “OK” means the task is done and configured correctly from the last run, or “changed” if Ansible finds the task alters the current state configured on the managed node(s).\nPLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************************************************************************************\nansible-node1              : ok=28   changed=10   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=1    rescued=0    ignored=0\nansible-node2              : ok=28   changed=11   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=1    rescued=0    ignored=0\nTo see if WordPress is up and running, navigate to the managed node’s domain name or IP address. In our case, it would be the following:\n[&lt;http://10.23.45.20&gt;](&lt;http://10.23.45.20&gt;) → http://10.23.45.20/wp-admin/install.php\n[&lt;http://10.23.45.30&gt;](&lt;http://10.23.45.30&gt;) → http://10.23.45.30/wp-admin/install.php\n\n\n\nwordpress-1\n\n\nAfter selecting the language you’d like to use for your WordPress installation, you’ll be presented with a final step to set up your WordPress user and password so you can log into your control panel. Setting up the name of your site, email, and login credentials is straightforward at this stage.\n\n\n\nwordpress-2\n\n\nOnce you log in, you will be taken to the WordPress administration dashboard:\n\n\n\nwordpress-3\n\n\nSome common next steps for customizing your WordPress installation include choosing the permalinks setting for your posts (can be found in Settings &gt; Permalinks) and selecting a new theme (in Appearance &gt; Themes).

    "text": "Deploy Flask API + MongoDB app on Kubernetes\nWe will develop a simple Python Flask API application, which will communicate to a MongoDB database, containerize it using Docker, and deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nPrerequisites for development on a local machine\nInstall the following python libraries using pip located in the requirements.txt file in the payment-app directory. You will have Flask running locally on your machine prior to deploying the Docker image to Kubernetes.\n$ cd ansible-kops/payment-app\n$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user\n$ pip list\n\n\nCreating the Flask Payment application\n\nWe’ll produce a simple RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) payment entries. The app will store the data in a MongoDB database, an open-source database that stores flexible JSON-like documents that is Non-relational (often called NoSQL databases).\nBy default, when a MongoDB Server instance starts on a machine, it listens to port 27017. The Flask-PyMongo module helps us to bridge Flask and MongoDB and provides some convenience helpers. An objectId module is a tool for working with MongoDB ObjectId, the default value of _id field of each document, generated during the creation of any document.\nThe app.py which can run on any host (python app.py), can be accessed at http://localhost:5000/.\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\nfrom flask_pymongo import PyMongo\nfrom bson.objectid import ObjectId\nfrom flask_cors import CORS\nimport socket\n\n# Configuration\nDEBUG = True\n\n# Instantiate the app\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"MONGO_URI\"] = \"mongodb://mongo:27017/dev\"\napp.config['JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR'] = True\nmongo = PyMongo(app)\ndb = mongo.db\n\n# enable CORS\nCORS(app, resources={r'/*': {'origins': '*'}})\n\n# UI message to show which pods the Payment API container is running\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    hostname = socket.gethostname()\n    return jsonify(\n        message=\"Welcome to the EasyPay app. I am running inside the {} pod!\".format(hostname)\n    )\n\n@app.route(\"/payments\")\ndef get_all_payments():\n    payments = db.payment.find()\n    data = []\n    for payment in payments:\n        item = {\n            \"id\": str(payment[\"_id\"]),\n            \"payment\": payment[\"payment\"]\n        }\n        data.append(item)\n    return jsonify(\n        data=data\n    )\n\n# POST Method to collect a user's payment\n@app.route(\"/payments\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef add_payment():\n    data = request.get_json(force=True)\n    db.payment.insert_one({\"payment\": data[\"payment\"]})\n    return jsonify(\n        message=\"Payment saved successfully to your account!\"\n    )\n\n# PUT Method to update a user's payment\n@app.route(\"/payments/&lt;id&gt;\", methods=[\"PUT\"])\ndef update_payment(id):\n    data = request.get_json(force=True)[\"payment\"]\n    response = db.payment.update_one({\"_id\": ObjectId(id)}, {\"$set\": {\"payment\": data}})\n    if response.matched_count:\n        message = \"Payment updated successfully!\"\n    else:\n        message = \"No Payments were found!\"\n    return jsonify(\n        message=message\n    )\n\n# DELETE Method to delete a user's payment\n@app.route(\"/payments/&lt;id&gt;\", methods=[\"DELETE\"])\ndef delete_payment(id):\n    response = db.payment.delete_one({\"_id\": ObjectId(id)})\n    if response.deleted_count:\n        message = \"Payment deleted successfully!\"\n    else:\n        message = \"No Payments were found!\"\n    return jsonify(\n        message=message\n    )\n\n# POST Method to delet all payment data\n@app.route(\"/payments/delete\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef delete_all_payments():\n    db.payment.remove()\n    return jsonify(\n        message=\"All Payments deleted!\"\n    )\n\n# The app server will be able to run locally at port 5000\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=5000)\nWe first import all the required modules and create instances of the Flask class (the app) and the PyMongo class (the database). Note that the hostname in the MONGO_URI Flask configuration variable defines the mongo instead of localhost. Mongo will be the name of our database container, and containers in the same Docker network can talk to each other by their names.\nOur app consists of six functions which are assigned URLs by @app.route() Python decorator. At first glance, it is easy to understand that the decorator is telling our app to execute the underlying function whenever a user visits our @app domain at the given route().\n\nindex() - displays a welcome message for the app. It Also displays the hostname of the machine where our app is running. This is useful to understand that we will be hitting a random pod each time we try to access our app on Kubernetes.\nget_all_payments() - displays all the payments that are available in the database as a list of dictionaries.\nadd_payment() - adds a new payment that is stored in the database with a unique ID.\nupdate_payment(id) - modifies any existing payment entry. If no payment data is found with the queried ID, the appropriate message is returned.\ndelete_payment(id) - removes that entry of the task having the queried ID from the database. Returns appropriate message if no task with the specified ID is found.\ndelete_all_payments() - removes all the payment data and returns an empty list.\n\nIn the final section, where we run the app, we define the host parameter as ‘0.0.0.0’ to make the server publicly available, running on the machine’s IP address, which will be inside a unique container.\n\n\nContainerizing the application\n\nOnce you have Docker installed locally, we will store our images to Docker Hub. Use the docker login command to authorize Docker to connect to your Docker Hub account.\nLet’s build a Docker image of the app to push to the Docker Hub registry. In the directory payment-app, a Dockerfile with the following contents to create the image:\n######################################\n# ~~ DOCKERFILE for Flask API app ~~ #\n######################################\n\nFROM python:alpine3.9\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nENV PORT 5000\nEXPOSE 5000\nENTRYPOINT [ \"python\" ]\nCMD [ \"app.py\" ]\nWe are using the official Python3.9 image, based on the Alpine Linux project, as the base image and copying our working directory’s contents to a new directory on the image. We are instructing the image to expose the port 5000 when run as a container, on which we can access our app. Finally, our app container configures to run python app.py automatically when deployed to a pod.\nHere, we build our image with the tag &lt;username&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;:&lt;version&gt; format using the below command:\n$ docker build -t ctgraves16/paymentapp-python:1.0.0 .\nand then push it to the Docker Hub registry. It will be publicly available where anyone in the world can download and run it:\n$ docker push ctgraves16/paymentapp-python:1.0.0\n\n👉🏾 NOTE: Ensure to replace “ctgraves16” with your Docker Hub username.\n\nNow that we containerized the app, what about the database? How can we containerize that? We don’t have to worry about it as we can easily use the official mongo Docker image and run it on the same network as the app container.\nRun the below commands to test the image locally where it can be accessible at http://localhost:5000/\n$ docker network create payment-app-net\n$ docker run --name=mongo --rm -d --network=payment-app-net mongo\n$ docker run --name=paymentapp-python --rm -p 5000:5000 -d --network=payment-app-net ctgraves16/paymentapp-python:1.0.0\n\n\n\nPayment App on Localhost\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the application and MongoDB database to Kubernetes\n\nWe can check on how the nodes are set up by running kubectl get nodes.\n~/ansible-kops$ kubectl get nodes\nNAME                             STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION\nip-172-20-125-204.ec2.internal   Ready    node                   17h   v1.21.3\nip-172-20-42-157.ec2.internal    Ready    control-plane,master   17h   v1.21.3\nip-172-20-50-137.ec2.internal    Ready    node                   17h   v1.21.3\nip-172-20-81-89.ec2.internal     Ready    node                   17h   v1.21.3\nThe deploy.sh script automates all the steps for setting up the deployments and services.

An HPA resource is at the pod level, and it scales the pods in a deployment or replica set. It implements as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each HorizontalPodAutoscaler definition. It obtains the metrics from either the resource metrics API (for per-pod resource metrics) or the custom metrics API (for all other metrics).\napiVersion: autoscaling/v1\nkind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\nmetadata:\n  name: payment-app-hpa\nspec:\n  maxReplicas: 10\n  minReplicas: 3\n  scaleTargetRef:\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: payment-app\n  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50\nNow that the complete application setup is ready, we can interact with the Flask app at easypay.ctgkube.com.\n\n\n\npayment-app-kubernetes\n\n\nWe can try all the API methods specified in the app to interact with the data from the command line.\n$ curl http://easypay.ctgkube.com\n{\n  \"message\": \"Welcome to the EasyPay app. I am running inside the payment-app-99695c66b-dv776 pod!\"\n}\n\n$ curl http://easypay.ctgkube.com/payments\n{\n  \"data\": [ \n    {\n      \"id\": \"61207498207b153038b3b0b3\", \n      \"payment\": \"00.00\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"id\": \"612074b5207b153038b3b0b4\", \n      \"payment\": \"500.00\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"id\": \"612074df879dd6b7458ac593\", \n      \"payment\": \"99.99\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"id\": \"61207582879dd6b7458ac594\", \n      \"payment\": \"199.99\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n$ curl -X POST -d \"{\\\"payment\\\": \\\"19.99\\\"}\" http://easypay.ctgkube.com/payments\n{\n  \"message\": \"Payment saved successfully to your account!\"\n}\n\n$ curl -X DELETE easypay.ctgkube.com/payments/61217595207b153038b3b0b6\n{\n  \"message\": \"Payment deleted successfully!\"\n}\n\n$ curl easypay.ctgkube.com/payments\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"61206c7864a10df0ec229aca\", \n      \"payment\": \"29.99\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"id\": \"61206c8764a10df0ec229acb\", \n      \"payment\": \"2000.00\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"id\": \"612074b5207b153038b3b0b4\", \n      \"payment\": \"500.00\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"id\": \"61207573207b153038b3b0b5\", \n      \"payment\": \"99.99\"\n    }, \n    {\n      \"id\": \"61207582879dd6b7458ac594\", \n      \"payment\": \"199.99\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n$ curl -X POST easypay.ctgkube.com/payments/delete\n{\n  \"message\": \"All Payments deleted!\"\n}\n\n$ curl easypay.ctgkube.com/payments\n{\n  \"data\": []\n}\n\n\n\neasypay.ctgkube.com-payments\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault-deployments-kubernetes-dashboard\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the Metrics server\n\nWithin the ansible-kops repository, we have the metrics server resource files stored in the kubernetes/metrics-server folder.

Once the load decreases, the replica set will scale back down to its orginal state of 3.\n$ kubectl get hpa -w\nNAME              REFERENCE                TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   1%/50%    3         10        3          4d4h\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   559%/50%   3         10        3          4d4h\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   559%/50%   3         10        6          4d4h\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   559%/50%   3         10        10         4d4h\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   247%/50%   3         10        10         4d4h\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   1%/50%     3         10        10         4d4h\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   1%/50%     3         10        10         4d5h\npayment-app-hpa   Deployment/payment-app   1%/50%     3         10        3          4d5h\n\n$ kubectl top pods --use-protocol-buffers\nNAME                            CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)   \nexternal-dns-7ff5ccbb48-p8wdd   1m           17Mi            \nmongo-786f4cb565-dr62t          129m         97Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-2r54p    170m         24Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-46hzw    169m         25Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-4vl9t    177m         31Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-6vbhw    174m         25Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-g6l7c    180m         25Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-pkwnz    177m         31Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-q6b7l    170m         24Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-s42wl    173m         25Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-sjwm2    170m         24Mi            \npayment-app-767748b689-xkpct    180m         25Mi\n\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nexternal-dns-7ff5ccbb48-p8wdd   1/1     Running   0          20h\nmongo-786f4cb565-dr62t          1/1     Running   0          20h\npayment-app-767748b689-2r54p    1/1     Running   0          77s\npayment-app-767748b689-46hzw    1/1     Running   0          92s\npayment-app-767748b689-4vl9t    1/1     Running   0          49m\npayment-app-767748b689-6vbhw    1/1     Running   0          48m\npayment-app-767748b689-g6l7c    1/1     Running   0          92s\npayment-app-767748b689-pkwnz    1/1     Running   0          48m\npayment-app-767748b689-q6b7l    1/1     Running   0          77s\npayment-app-767748b689-s42wl    1/1     Running   0          92s\npayment-app-767748b689-sjwm2    1/1     Running   0          77s\npayment-app-767748b689-xkpct    1/1     Running   0          77s\n\n\n\nhpa-deployments-kubernetes-dashboard"

project, I explored two approaches for boat classification:\n\nCustom CNN: Built from scratch specifically for this task\nTransfer Learning with MobileNetV2: Leveraged a pre-trained model for feature extraction\n\n\n\n\nBoth models did not achieve accuracy above 80% when evaluating the test images\nThe MobileNetV2 transfer learning model showed a significant gap between training and test accuracy, indicating potential overfitting\nChallenges affecting model performance may include:\n\nClass imbalance: Variations in the number of examples across boat types\nLimited data: Relatively small dataset leading to overfitting\nComplex task: Boat classification requires capturing nuanced features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress class imbalance with techniques like data augmentation, oversampling, or class weights\nCollect more labeled data, especially for minority classes\nFine-tune model architectures and hyperparameters to reduce overfitting\n\nThis project demonstrated the application of deep learning techniques to an important real-world problem in port automation and laid the groundwork for further refinement of boat classification models."

    "text": "In this project, I explored two approaches for boat classification:\n\nCustom CNN: Built from scratch specifically for this task\nTransfer Learning with MobileNetV2: Leveraged a pre-trained model for feature extraction\n\n\n\n\nBoth models did not achieve accuracy above 80% when evaluating the test images\nThe MobileNetV2 transfer learning model showed a significant gap between training and test accuracy, indicating potential overfitting\nChallenges affecting model performance may include:\n\nClass imbalance: Variations in the number of examples across boat types\nLimited data: Relatively small dataset leading to overfitting\nComplex task: Boat classification requires capturing nuanced features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress class imbalance with techniques like data augmentation, oversampling, or class weights\nCollect more labeled data, especially for minority classes\nFine-tune model architectures and hyperparameters to reduce overfitting\n\nThis project demonstrated the application of deep learning techniques to an important real-world problem in port automation and laid the groundwork for further refinement of boat classification models."

If the p-value is less than our chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence of a significant association between the variables.\n\n# Import required libraries\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\n\n# Create a contingency table\ncont_table = pd.crosstab(df['Complaint Type'], df['City'])\n\n# Perform the chi-square test\nchi2, pval, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(cont_table)\n\n# Set significance level\nalpha = 0.05\n\n# Print results\nprint(f\"Chi-square value: {chi2}\")\nprint(f\"P-value: {pval}\")\nprint(f\"Degrees of freedom: {dof}\")\nprint(\"Expected frequencies:\")\nprint(expected)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Check if p-value is less than alpha\nif p_value &lt; alpha:\n    print(\"There is a significant difference between the two groups.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"There is no significant difference between the two groups.\")\n\nChi-square value: 145971.80461890675\nP-value: 0.0\nDegrees of freedom: 1166\nExpected frequencies:\n[[5.72095964e-03 1.76510380e-01 1.99902258e-02 ... 6.85189838e-02\n  9.62402361e-02 3.66671545e-03]\n [7.53021313e+00 2.32331788e+02 2.63121347e+01 ... 9.01881124e+01\n  1.26676211e+02 4.82631421e+00]\n [7.15119955e-04 2.20637975e-02 2.49877822e-03 ... 8.56487298e-03\n  1.20300295e-02 4.58339431e-04]\n ...\n [3.71576329e+00 1.14643492e+02 1.29836516e+01 ... 4.45030800e+01\n  6.25080334e+01 2.38153168e+00]\n [4.58391891e-01 1.41428942e+01 1.60171684e+00 ... 5.49008358e+00\n  7.71124892e+00 2.93795575e-01]\n [2.99277701e+00 9.23369927e+01 1.04573869e+01 ... 3.58439934e+01\n  5.03456735e+01 1.91815052e+00]]\n\n\nThere is no significant difference between the two groups."

The timeout that occurs with the connectivity of the database has been the reason for the issue.\nWhile troubleshooting, it is found that the database server has several downtime instances at irregular intervals. This situation compels the company to create its own infrastructure that runs in high-availability mode.\nGiven that online shopping experiences continue to evolve as per customer expectations, we’ll need to build infrastructe that can make the app more reliable, fast, and secure for improving the performance of the current system implementation."
