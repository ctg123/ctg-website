# About Me

Welcome to my website! 👋🏾

My name is Chaance Graves. Welcome to my website, where I share my blog on `topics ...` and projects that I’ve worked on or still tinkering with. I’m a creative problem solver eager to implement solutions to many issues foreseen in our modern society. In addition to that, I am also a big advocate for giving back to others who aspire to follow a path like mine.

## Navigation

On this site I keep a list of my [projects](projects.html), **notes**, my [resume](resume.html), as well as a [technical blog](blog.html).

## Interests

- Systems Engineering 💡
- Computer Architecture
- Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning)
- Wireless Communications
- Renewable Energy
