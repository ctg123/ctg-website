Welcome to my website! üëãüèæ

I'm an Electrical Engineer specializing in hardware systems development, automation, and AI-driven solutions. In particular, I'm interested in diving deeper into Embedded Systems Engineering and Low Power Design & Optimization.

Beyond my professional work, I‚Äôm also passionate about [self-hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) ‚Äî the practice of running your own applications and services instead of relying on third parties. It gives me more control over my data and allows me to experiment with emerging technologies on my own terms.

## What I Do

I bring experience in analyzing and troubleshooting complex systems, developing automation scripts, and optimizing system performance, particularly within the context of x86 and ARM-based hardware and software. My technical experience spans:

- OEM/ODM Product Development support for Cloud & Enterprise
- AI Infrastructure and Operations with familarity in Networking
- FPGA development
- Embedded Systems

## What You'll Find Here

My site here will serve as my hub where I share:

- [Projects](projects.html): In-depth studies of my technical work and experiments, which are all open source.
- [Blog](blog.html): Insights on tech trends, tutorials, and my perspective on industry developments.
- [Resume](https://resume.chaancegraves.com): My professional background and skillset.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to collaborating, mentoring, and exchanging ideas with fellow technology enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out through LinkedIn or check out my detailed experience on my resume.

As a strong believer in knowledge sharing and continous learning, I'm committed to helping others who are curious or eager to grow. Whether you're a experienced professional or just starting your tech journey, I'd love to connect!
