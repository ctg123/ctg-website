Welcome to my website! 👋🏾

My name is Chaance Graves. Welcome to my website, where I share the projects that I’ve worked on or still tinkering with. I’m a creative problem solver eager to implement solutions to many issues foreseen in our modern society. In addition to that, I am also a big advocate for giving back to others who aspire to follow a path like mine.
